- the one that goes up -> maby include lambdas parameter to fitness or increase n_last to get more interesinng and dynamic results
- use fitness function that looks at smiley pattern globally and not neccesarrily in the same place like CNNs
- average fintesee massively drops off, when supposed point of convergence is reached -> probybly because of too high mutationrate change, when no improvement is detected
- fitness: no camparison between differnt targets possible
- baseline:all white
